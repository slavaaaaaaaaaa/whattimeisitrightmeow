# What time is it right meow?

You know you want to find out.

Who needs ntp when you have this?

## Status

Dead. GitHub started noticeably lagging on the repo page, and even my slowpoke of a VPS started to struggle pushing the changes in less than thirty seconds. A solution is to bump my sleep limit, but more importantly, [GitHub itself is mad](github_letter.png). It was a good run!

## Usage

Fork me, eat me, put me in a tree

Run `./bin/time.sh` forever

Watch your own personalized time!

## Do I use this?

Hell yes I do, [in prod](https://github.com/naftulikay/ansible-role-time/pull/7). Someone tell him to merge it already!

## Contributing

Only if you really want to.

## Historical nonsense

I woke up one morning after seeing the masterpiece of Bojack Horseman and thought:

```thoughts
"what's the worst possible way I can show time on the internet?"
```

Behold.
